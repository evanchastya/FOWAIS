FOWAIS: Food Waste Reduction Intelligent System

FOWAIS is a desktop application designed to help supermarkets predict future product demand and identify inventory at high risk of spoilage or waste. It uses a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) machine learning model, built with Scikit-Learn, to forecast sales and recommends immediate actions (Donation, Discount, or Disposal) based on stock levels and expiry dates.
